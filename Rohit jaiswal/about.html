            <p>
                Second-year B.Tech student, future Software Engineer and Developer. My passion for Computer Science has brought me to the School of Computer Engineering at Kalinga Institute Of Industrial Technology, where I am working on my skills in computer Applications.
                Last semester I completed the Foundation program, which covered basic subjects like Engineering Graphics, Biology, Mathematics basic computer, and others. The most valuable lesson I have learned from this Btech has been the importance
                of basic Computer skills and knowledge before moving into different fields and specialization. Even though I knew I wanted to be a Software Engineer and Developer, I have enjoyed getting back to basics in a different curriculum. My class
                in Computer Applications has provided me with great insights for a future career in Software development and Engineering. This year I have mastered C language, Java, and basics of C++. I continue to build skills in Etherial Blockchain
                and Decentralized APPS as well as getting myself used to the basics of Networking and cloud computing. Next year, I hope to complete an SDE internship that will provide real-life experience and important technological skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for
                getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.
